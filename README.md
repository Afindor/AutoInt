## Introduction

AutoIntï¼šAn effective and efficient algorithm to
automatically learn the high-order feature combinations of input
features

The illustration of AutoInt. We first projects all sparse features
(both categorical and numerical features) into the low-dimensional space. Next, we feed embeddings of all fields into a interacting layer implemented by self-attentive neural network. The output of the final interacting layer is the low-dimensional representation of the input feature, which is further used for estimating the CTR via sigmoid function.
